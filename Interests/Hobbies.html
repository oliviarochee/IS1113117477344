 <p><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Reading, walking, music and yoga.</p>
 <p> I do yoga classes three times a week in the maradyke, with my friends, which I love!</p>
 <p> I also love to read book in my spare time. I adore crime novels, and detective series. My favourite author is James Patterson. I have been reading his books for years!</p>
<p> Something else I love to do is walking. I walk every morning to college from the train station which is a 40 minute walk each way. I usually listen to music on my way. I find the fresh air really clears my head and sets me up for the day!</p>
<p> I also love to listen to music. I find it to be such a great stress reliever and mood lifter!</p>
