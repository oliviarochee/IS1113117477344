	<div class="section" id = "sectioncloud"><strong>Cloud Services:</strong><br/><br/>In the simplest terms, Cloud services and cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet. Cloud computing lets you keep information on a remote server (the cloud), instead of trapped in a computer. !</div>
	<div class="section" id = "sectionuse"><strong>Cloud Services I Use:</strong><br/><br/>Since starting college and studying Business Information Systems, I have become aware of new cloud services which I have incorporated into my daily life. These include Gmail, AWS, Cloud 9 and dropbox.</div>
	<div class="section" id = "sectionfavourite"><strong> My Favourite Cloud Service:</strong><br/><br/> My personal favourite Cloud Service would be Gmail. Gmail is Google's free email service. You can find Gmail at mail.google.com. If you have a Google account, you already have a Gmail account. Some benefits, and many reasons why I love Gmail could be :
	<br/>
	Most email services offer some sort of spam filtering these days, and Google's is very effective. Gmail attempts to filter advertising spam, viruses, and phishing attempts. This results in less junk mail in your Inbox which is really useful.
	<br/>
	Another benefit is certainly how Gmail became popular by giving users ample storage space. Rather than deleting old messages, you could archive them. Today Gmail storage space is shared across Google accounts including Google Drive. As of this writing, the free storage space is 15 gigs across all accounts, but you can buy additional storage space if necessary. 
	<br/>
	Finally, Gmail, unlike other email services controls the apperances of ads. These ads appear on the side panel of mail messages when you open them from within Gmail's website. The ads are unobtrusive and computer matched to keywords within the mail message.Unlike some competitors, Gmail does not put ads on messages or append anything to your outgoing mail. The ads are computer-generated, not placed there by humans.Currently, there are no ads appearing on Gmail messages on Android phones.
