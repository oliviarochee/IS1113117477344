	<div class="section" id = "sectioncloud">Cloud Services: In the simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet. Cloud computing lets you keep information on a remote server (the cloud), instead of trapped in a computer.</div>
	<div class="section" id = "sectionuse">Cloud Services I use: Through college and my personal life, I use plenty of cloud services. These include Gmail, Cloud9, Dropbox, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).</div>
	<div class="section" id = "sectionfavourite" >My favourite Cloud Service: My personal favourite Cloud Service that I use daily would be Gmail. Gmail is Google's free email service. You can find Gmail at mail.google.com. If you have a Google account, you already have a Gmail account. Some of Gmails benefits and the many reasons I love it would be:
	<br/>
	The ads are unobtrusive and computer matched to keywords within the mail message, and currently there are no ads on Iphones or Android Gmail apps.
	<br/> 
	Another benefit would be that Gmail attempts to filter advertising spam, viruses, and phishing attempts. This means there is less junk in my inbox.</div>
	<br/> 
	Finally, Gmail became popular by giving users ample storage space. Rather than deleting old messages, you could archive them. Today Gmail storage space is shared across Google accounts including Google Drive. As of this writing, the free storage space is 15 gigs across all accounts, but you can buy additional storage space if necessary. I find this so useful as it means I do not need more than one email account to store all my emails and information.</div>
