 <p><strong>Cloud Service examples:</strong> Amazon Web Services, Salesforce, Gmail, Cloud9.</p>
 <p> A cloud service is any service made available to users on demand via the Internet from a cloud computing provider's servers as opposed to being provided from a company's own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider.
There are many cloud services available such as Amazon Web Services, Salesforce, Gmail, Cloud9. <br> <br> My own personal favourite cloud service from the list above would be Gmail. Gmail is a free, advertising-supported email service developed by Google. Users can access Gmail on the web and using third-party programs that synchronize email content through POP or IMAP protocols. Gmail started as a limited beta release on April 1, 2004, and ended its testing phase on July 7, 2009. As of July 2017, Gmail has 1.2 billion active users worldwide,[citation needed] and was the first app on the Google Play Store to hit one billion installations on Android devices. According to a 2014 estimate, 60% of mid-sized US companies, and 92% of startups, were using Gmail.Its is an easy to use and quick way of accessing your mail and i find the fact is comes in an app form to be an extra plus! </p>
